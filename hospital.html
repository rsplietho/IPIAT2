    <p id="welcome">Doctor : “Hello, sorry for such a sudden message but your mom had a heart attack on the street. The bypassers called 911 so we called you as soon as we could. Your mom has a rare decease called Ligma and the only way to fix it is with a surgery that is rather expensive. You would need about half a million dollars and insurance sadly wont cover any of that.” 
    You: “I don’t have that kind of money doctor, what can I do??”</p>
